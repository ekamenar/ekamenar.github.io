We recently concluded our participation in the <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/ds25/">SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS25) in Denver, USA</a>. The event provided an excellent platform for exchanging ideas and engaging with leading experts in the field, particularly in the area of Koopman Operator Theory.

During the conference, I had the privilege of presenting our collaborative work with Tomislav Bazina (University of Rijeka, Croatia), Maria Fonoberova (AIMdyn, Inc., U.S.), and Igor Mezic (University of California, Santa Barbara, U.S.) entitled "Koopman-Driven Grip Force Prediction Through EMG Sensing."

Additionally, I had the opportunity to co-organize the minisymposium, <a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=82708">Diverse Applications of the Koopman Operator Theory</a>, alongside Yoshihiko Susuki and William Redman. The session fostered insightful discussions and highlighted the growing impact of Koopman Operator Theory across various applications. Details about the session are available here.

We extend our gratitude to all participants and contributors for their valuable engagement. The conference was a source of inspiration, and we look forward to applying the new ideas and perspectives gained to our ongoing research.
