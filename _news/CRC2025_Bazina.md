We're excited to announce that Tomislav Bazina presented our research on **"Koopman-Based Prediction of Hand Grip Force Using sEMG"** at the inaugural <a href="https://www.dof-crc.hr/">Croatian Robotics Conference (CRC 2025)</a> hosted at the "Regionalni centar kompetentnosti Tehničke škole Čakovec"!

Our team showcased how Koopman operator theory can be applied to surface electromyography signals to estimate and forecast grip force with remarkable accuracy. This project demonstrates our ongoing commitment to advancing data-driven modeling techniques with real-world impact.

The conference brought together Croatia's brightest minds in robotics, with stimulating discussions on technology transfer between academia and industry.

Our research has exciting applications for adaptive rehabilitation devices that provide "assist-as-needed" support for patients recovering from stroke or neurological conditions. We're proud to contribute to tools that help those working to reclaim everyday tasks.

Special thanks to the DoF Robotics Association for organizing this important platform for the Croatian robotics community.
