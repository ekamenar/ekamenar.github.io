Our project, <em>“Advanced soft robots: data-driven development, modeling and control”</em>, has been selected for funding by the Croatian Science Foundation!

Huge congratulations to my team — **Tomislav Bazina**, **Jelena Srnec Novak, PhD**, **David Liović**, and **Adelmo Šegota** — whose tremendous effort in preparing the proposal and documentation made this success possible. Having a strong idea is essential, but clearly communicating that idea so that reviewers understand what you want to achieve is just as important — and it seems we succeeded this time.

I am especially grateful to **Igor Mezić** for his support and for the many discussions that helped shape the project concept, ultimately contributing to securing **first place among the 11 projects funded in this category**.

We also extend our sincere thanks to **Elliot W. Hawkes**, **Tea Schnurrer**, and **Francesco De Bona** (University of Udine). Your letters of support significantly strengthened our application.
