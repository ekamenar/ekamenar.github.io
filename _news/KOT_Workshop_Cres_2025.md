The second international workshop, **“Koopman Operator Theory: Fundamentals, Approximations and Applications,”** was held from September 10 to 12, 2025, at the historic <a href="https://moisepalace.com">Moise Palace</a> on the island of Cres, Croatia. Sponsored by the <a href="https://www.uniri.hr">University of Rijeka</a>, the <a href="https://www.riteh.uniri.hr">University of Rijeka, Faculty of Engineering</a>, and <a href="https://uniri.hr/en/university-and-community/palace-moise/">Moise Palace</a>, the workshop was organized by Igor Mezić (UC Santa Barbara) and Ervin Kamenar (Faculty of Engineering, Rijeka). The scientific committee included distinguished experts Prof. Zlatko Drmač (University of Zagreb), Prof. Yoshi Susuki (Kyoto University), and Prof. Alexandre Mauroy (University of Namur).

The workshop focused on the cutting-edge integration of **machine learning and artificial intelligence within Koopman operator theory**, highlighting its theoretical developments and diverse applications across robotics, climate science, biology, healthcare, and AI. Approximately 30 scientists from prestigious institutions worldwide participated, representing:

- **USA:** UC Santa Barbara, Caltech, MIT, Johns Hopkins, University of Colorado (Colorado Springs), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Dartmouth, University of Maryland
- **Italy:** University of Bologna
- **Croatia:** University of Zagreb, University of Rijeka
- **Belgium:** University of Namur
- **Japan:** Kyoto University, Institute of Science Tokyo
- **Germany:** Technical University of Munich, Ilmenau University of Technology
- **United Kingdom:** University of Leicester
- **Scotland:** Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh
- **Australia:** University of Sydney
- **Netherlands:** Eindhoven University of Technology

Over the three-day event, participants engaged in lectures, collaborative discussions, and strategic planning sessions aimed at interdisciplinary cooperation and defining future research directions. A standout moment was a special session on a boat anchored near Valun, where young researchers exchanged ideas, shared perspectives on research challenges, and proposed innovative directions and applications for further advancing Koopman operator theory. The scenic maritime setting fostered a uniquely inspiring and informal environment for dialogue.

Looking ahead, the third edition of the workshop is planned for 2026 in Kyoto, Japan, promising further enhancement of this vibrant international research community.
