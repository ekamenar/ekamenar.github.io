Marylou Loustalet and Hugo Mezzatesta, students from France who stayed with us for four months, are heading back to France.

They worked on the 3D design of a finger prosthesis for the rehabilitation of patients with reduced hand mobility, based on soft-robotic principles. We hope to continue our collaboration and see Hugo and Marylou again in the future!
