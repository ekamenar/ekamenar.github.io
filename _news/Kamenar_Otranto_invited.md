Dr. Kamenar gave an invited talk "Koopman meets soft robots" as part of the Koopman Operator Theory: Fundamentals, Approximations, and Applications workshop organized in a beautiful Aragonese Castle (Piazza Castello, Otranto, LE 73028, Italy).

The Workshop was conducted in an interdisciplinary setting to foster discussions on further developments and investigations on the role that this recently rediscovered object may play in theoretical and data driven research.
