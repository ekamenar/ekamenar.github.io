We are pleased to announce the launch of the **KOT Forum YouTube channel**, initiated after discussions at the recent 
<a href="https://uniri.hr/en/science-and-research/koopman-operator-theory-fundamentals-approximations-and-applications/" target="_blank">Koopman Operator Theory Workshop in Cres, Croatia</a>.

**Channel link:** <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KOTForum" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@KOTForum</a>

In addition to the workshop presentations, the channel will include recordings of our newly established **monthly Koopman operator theory seminars**, creating an accessible archive for the expanding Koopman community.

### Monthly Koopman Seminars

Following the Cres workshop, we created a monthly Zoom seminar series to bring together researchers working on Koopman operator theory across fundamentals, approximations, and diverse applications.

If you would like your students, collaborators, or colleagues to be added to the seminar mailing list, please feel free to contact me at  
<a href="mailto:&#101;&#107;&#097;&#109;&#101;&#110;&#097;&#114;&#064;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#114;&#105;&#046;&#104;&#114;">&#101;&#107;&#097;&#109;&#101;&#110;&#097;&#114;&#064;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#114;&#105;&#046;&#104;&#114;</a>.  
We also welcome speakers interested in presenting their work in future sessions.

The YouTube channel will feature seminar recordings and related content as the community continues to grow.
