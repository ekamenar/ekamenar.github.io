We are pleased to announce that we are organizing the workshop <a href="https://uniri.hr/en/science-and-research/koopman-operator-theory-fundamentals-approximations-and-applications/">"Koopman Operator Theory: Fundamentals, Approximations and Applications 2"</a>!

---

The workshop will be held from \textbf{September 10th to 12th, 2025} in <a href="https://uniri.hr/en/university-and-community/palace-moise/">Moise palace, Cres</a>. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the <a href="https://uniri.hr/en/home/">University of Rijeka</a> for sponsoring this magnificent venue!

The workshop is organized by Igor Mezić (UC Santa Barbara, USA), Antonio Navarra (University of Bologna & Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, Italy), and Ervin Kamenar (University of Rijeka, Faculty of Engineering).

The Scientific Committee for the workshop includes: Zlatko Drmač (University of Zagreb, Faculty of Science, Croatia), Yoshihiko Susuki (Kyoto University, Japan), Alexandre Mauroy (University of Namur, Belgium), Igor Mezić, Antonio Navarra, and Ervin Kamenar.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from diverse areas of Koopman-operator-driven research. Topics will include recent advances in robotics and biological applications, innovations in climate science leveraging Koopman operator methods, control-oriented applications, and emerging applications in artificial intelligence. Additionally, the workshop will explore how insights from these applications contribute to theoretical developments in the field.

The expected outcome of the workshop is a structured roadmap that outlines key research challenges, recent advancements, and future directions in Koopman Operator Theory, guiding the community in its ongoing and future efforts.
