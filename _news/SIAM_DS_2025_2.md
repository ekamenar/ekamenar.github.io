We recently concluded our participation in the <a href="https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/ds25/">"SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems (DS25) in Denver, USA"</a>. The event provided an excellent platform for exchanging ideas and engaging with leading experts in the field, particularly in the area of Koopman Operator Theory.

During the conference, I had the privilege of presenting our collaborative work with Tomislav Bazina (University of Rijeka, Croatia), Maria Fonoberova (AIMdyn, Inc., U.S.), and Igor Mezic (University of California, Santa Barbara, U.S.) entitled "Koopman-Driven Grip Force Prediction Through EMG Sensing."

Additionally, I had the opportunity to co-organize the minisymposium, <a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=82708">"Diverse Applications of the Koopman Operator Theory"</a>, alongside Yoshihiko Susuki and William Redman. The session fostered insightful discussions and highlighted the growing impact of Koopman Operator Theory across various applications. Details about the session are available here.

We extend our gratitude to all participants and contributors for their valuable engagement. The conference was a source of inspiration, and we look forward to applying the new ideas and perspectives gained to our ongoing research.

**Minisymposium Abstract**

The Koopman operator approach to modeling, discovering, controlling, and analyzing dynamical systems has a rapidly expanding range of applications, such as robotics, biology, climate science, and artificial intelligence. Significant advances in theory and numerical methods enable rapid progress in corresponding application domains. The extension of Koopman operator methods to address new application problems has also given rise to new classes of theoretical and numerical problems. This two-part mini-symposium will bring together researchers from various areas of Koopman-operator-driven research, especially in applications. Drs. Asada, Mohammatdi, Gibson, and Kamenar will present the latest advances in robotics and biological applications using Koopman operator methods. Dr. Navarra will present recent advances in climate science using Koopman operator methods. Emerging applications in artificial intelligence will be introduced by Drs. Yeung and Redman. Dr. Vadiya will present a theoretical feedback of application research in terms of optimal design. The series of talks will provide new insights into diverse application domains and motivate the framing of common themes and research approaches for developing new mathematical theorems in Koopman operator theory.
