A preprint of the paper titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17340/">Koopman-driven Grip Force Prediction through EMG Sensing</a>, has been published on ArXiv!

The research is authored by Tomislav Bazina, Ervin Kamenar, Maria Fonoberova, and Igor MeziÄ‡ in collaboration with <a href="https://aimdyn.com/">AIMdyn, Inc.</a>

We would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (Award Number FA9550-22-1-0531) and the University of Rijeka (Grant UNIRI-ISKUSNI-23-4) for their support of this research.

The study focuses on estimating and predicting hand grip force using a single pair of surface electromyography (EMG) sensors. By applying novel signal processing techniques and a Koopman-based data-driven approach, the research achieved accurate real-time force estimations and predictions with minimal error.
