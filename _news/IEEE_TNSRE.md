The study focuses on estimating and predicting hand grip force using a single pair of surface electromyography (EMG) sensors. By applying novel signal processing techniques and a Koopman-based data-driven approach, the research achieved accurate real-time force estimations and predictions with minimal error. A static Koopman operator is used to estimate grip force from EMG measurements, while a dynamic Koopman operator predicts the future (up to 0.5 s ahead) state of the grip force from the current estimate. The whole framework is real-time ready and will be used in rehabilitation robotics applications.
