Topics will include recent advances in robotics and biological applications, innovations in climate science leveraging Koopman operator methods, control-oriented applications, and emerging applications in artificial intelligence. Additionally, the workshop will explore how insights from these applications contribute to theoretical developments in the field.</p> <p>The expected outcome of the workshop is a structured roadmap that outlines key research challenges, recent advancements, and future directions in Koopman Operator Theory, guiding the community in its ongoing and future efforts.</p> <p>More information on confirmed speakers, travel, and accommodation can be found here: <a href="https://uniri.hr/en/science-and-research/koopman-operator-theory-fundamentals-approximations-and-applications/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Koopman Operator Theory: Fundamentals, Approximations and Applications 2”</a></p> </body></html>
