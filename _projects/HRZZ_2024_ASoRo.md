Over the past 15 years, the study of nature-inspired soft robots has grown exponentially. Compared to rigid robots, they have tremendously improved human-machine interaction safety. As a result, they have become increasingly attractive in various medical fields, including robotic rehabilitation. However, inherent nonlinearity and formally infinite degrees of freedom hinder their development, modeling, and control, limiting their use outside the laboratory. Building on the Principal Investigator’s previous study “Control of Soft Robots with Inertial Dynamics” published in Science Robotics (2-year IF: 26.1), the proposed project aims to address these challenges within a biomechatronic design framework by establishing a new interdisciplinary research group and the “Laboratory for Bioinspired Robotics.” Leveraging the Koopman operator framework, data-driven modeling and development of controllers applicable to soft rehabilitation robots will be carried out. Data will be acquired using a motion capture system, and a method for modeling and forecasting grip strength through electromyographic sensors will be developed. This approach will enable real-time adaptivity of the device, allowing for adjustment of output force to optimize patient recovery during rehabilitation. In addition, by leveraging an interdisciplinary approach and fostering collaboration between engineers and medical experts, the project will examine the critical prerequisites for developing soft robots suitable for rehabilitation purposes. This includes conducting kinematic analyses of motion, selecting appropriate materials, and refining design parameters. Numerical and analytical models will be developed to optimize the designs and to achieve better durability and reliability, with experimental analyses validating these designs. The project will culminate in the development of a proof-of-concept prototype of an innovative soft robotic glove designed to rehabilitate patients with reduced hand mobility {% cite bazina2024koopman %}, {% cite haggerty2023control %}.
