<b>Abstract:</b>

Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROUV) are rapidly advancing underwater mapping technology. These small vessels, supported by surface ships, operate underwater for a few hours up to a day. Initial research revealed a lack of long-distance wireless control in existing ROUVs, prompting the development of a new submersible with long-distance control and a 50-meter working depth, while remaining cost-effective.

Communication is managed via an Internet modem, the most economical option meeting all requirements. A motorized winch on a float controls depth, chosen for its reliability and simpler construction. Brushless motors immersed in water provide propulsion. The ROUV design features a "T" configuration with two dry chambers and a camera, surrounded by casing with attached motors and winch cable.

Electronic components were selected for their affordability and suitability. The construction involved several sub-assemblies: the camera chamber, main chamber, outer casing, and engines. After assembly, testing confirmed the planned functionality but revealed issues such as winch slipping and water leakage.

<b>Keywords:</b>

Submersible, remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROUV), design and experimental testing of submersible.
