<b>Abstract:</b>

Hand rehabilitation aims to recover and improve hand functionality after injury, surgery, or neurological conditions. This rehabilitation benefits conditions like fractures, dislocations, ligament and tendon injuries, arthritis, strokes, or paralysis. The development of soft robots for rehabilitation offers significant advantages, enhancing the process with their flexibility and safety. Made from materials like rubber or fabric, soft robots can be customized to fit the patient’s body, providing comfort and precise control during therapy. They adapt to individual abilities and gradually increase therapy intensity as patients progress.

Initial research on soft robots explored various concepts to determine optimal geometries, with cylindrical and cellular segments being the most successful. Detailed studies and tests on these models, particularly model B (cylindrical segment), showed better performance in generating higher forces, crucial for hand rehabilitation. Efforts to improve model B by altering wall thickness found that the initial 2 mm thickness was optimal.

Model B was used to create a rehabilitation glove, which was then tested for functionality and effectiveness. This confirmed the glove’s capability in providing necessary support and guidance during rehabilitation.

Cylindrical and cellular segments are just examples of successful geometries in soft robot research. Other shapes are also being explored for various applications. Further research and development in soft robotics are advancing designs and functionalities, with potential applications in rehabilitation, medical therapy, environmental exploration, and industrial fields. Integrating sensors and measurement devices into these robots allows for monitoring and customization of therapy, offering motion capture, force measurement, electromyography (EMG), haptic feedback, progress tracking, and data analysis.
