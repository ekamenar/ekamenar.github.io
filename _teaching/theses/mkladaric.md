<b>Abstract:</b>

A glove for the rehabilitation of patients with reduced hand mobility is being developed. The device is based on the principles of soft robotics and pneumatic actuation. It is necessary to create a 3D model of the glove and simulate its operation using an appropriate software tool. Then, the glove needs to be manufactured using 3D printing from flexible materials and experimental measurements must be carried out.

<b>Keywords:</b>

rehabilitation glove, soft robotics, 3D printing
