<b>Course objectives:</b>

Understanding of basic terminology in control of mechatronic systems. Application of control systems to real control problems. Development of studentâ€™s capabilities to work autonomously in groups - team work. Project based learning and presentation of achieved results.

<b>Expected course learning outcomes:</b>

Explain the role and principles of control in mechatronics. Use Laplace transforms to solve linear differential equations that describe a mechatronics system being analysed. Define a block diagram of the considered system. Determine the transfer function of the system. Describe standard excitation functions. Define stability criteria for controled system. Draw Bode and Nyquist plots for the given transfer function. Describe the basic characteristics of the PID controller. Use Matlab/Simulink software packages for the analysis and solution of problems. Describe control of a mechatronics system by using control hardware and LabVIEW programming environement. Teamwork and written and oral communication with experts in the field. Implementation of the acquired knowledge to solve practical problems.
