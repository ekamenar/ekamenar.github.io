My name is David LABARTHE, I live in Pau and I'm currently in my fourth year of engineering school in this city, in the southwest of France. I'm actually in a work-study contract at <a href="https://www.daher.com/en/">DAHER</a> where I work as a methods and tools engineering apprentice. And as part of the curriculum of this year, I have the opportunity to do a 12 weeks internship abroad, where I'll work in Croatia under the supervision of Dr. Kamenar at the University of Rijeka, Faculty of Engineering.
