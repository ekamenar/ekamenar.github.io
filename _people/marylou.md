My name is Marylou Loustalet, I'm 21 and I'm currently in my fourth year of engineering school in France. As part of the validation of my year, I've had the opportunity to do a four-month professional training abroad. In France, I'm on a work-study contract with <a href="https://www.terega.fr/en/">Teréga</a>, where I'm an apprentice project manager. Teréga specialises in the storage and transport of gas through pipelines in the south of France. I'm currently doing a four-month professional training under the supervision of Dr Kamenar to further my knowledge of soft robotics.
