I specialize in mechatronics, robotics, and precision engineering, actively contributing to numerous research projects funded by organizations like the EU and national bodies. My work has led to co-authorship of several papers in esteemed peer-reviewed journals and presentations at international conferences. A highlight of my career includes publishing a notable paper in Science Robotics, a leading journal in robotics, in collaboration with UC Santa Barbara. Currently, I am an associate professor at the University of Rijeka, Faculty of Engineering (RITEH), deeply engaged in academic and research pursuits. Additionally, I contribute to the operations of the Centre for Micro- and Nanosciences and Technologies (NANORI), furthering advancements in these fields. Collaborating with AIMdyn, Inc., I explore Koopman operator theory and dynamical systems, enriching my research with practical applications. At RITEH, I teach courses like Mechatronics Systems Control and Advanced Control Methods in Precision Engineering, dedicating myself to fostering intellectual growth and technological advancement in engineering.
