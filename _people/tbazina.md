Tomislav Bazina is a PhD student with keen interest in data science and its application in measurement systems and rehabilitation robotics. He is engaged as a Research & Teaching assistant at University of Rijeka â€“ Faculty of Engineering (RITEH) and Centre for Micro- and Nanosciences and Technologies (NANORI), where he conducts scientific research related to D. Sc. thesis regarding the development of an upper limb rehabilitation device. 

He is also involved in a power transformer vibration measurement professional project, holds design and laboratory tutorials as part of the Machine Elements Design and Laboratory Exercises courses and participates in several public events dedicated to the promotion of science. Prior to that, and during his graduate study in mechanical engineering, he worked as a CAD/CAM/CNC programmer/operator for the production of hydraulic components and steel parts for general use in a couple of manufacturing companies. 

Also, he created several software packages for solving specific problems in application of machine vision for workpiece detection, recognition and dimensional inspection, for vibration analysis, and for the optimization of supply chains, manufacturing flow lines and turning process.
