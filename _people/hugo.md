My name is Hugo Mezzatesta, I am 22 years old, and I am currently in my fourth year of engineering school. I live in Pau, in the southwest of France, and I am doing a work-study program at <a href="https://www.nexteam-group.com/en/">NEXTEAM Group</a>. Additionally, I am undertaking a four-month internship in Croatia as part of my studies. Always motivated to develop my skills and take on new challenges, I strive to combine theoretical learning with practical professional experience.
